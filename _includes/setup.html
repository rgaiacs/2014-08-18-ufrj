<h3>Overview</h3>

    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
      The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
      which is not famous for being intuitive.
      if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
      try typing the escape key,
      followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
      then hitting Return
      to return to the shell.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div>
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash,
      so no need to install anything.  You access bash from
      the Terminal (found
      in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want
      to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
    </p>
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend
      <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
      <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
      which should be pre-installed.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git for Mac by downloading and running
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">the installer</a>.  For older
      versions of OS X (10.5-10.7) use the most recent available
      installer <a href="https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list">available
      here</a>. Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow Leopard
      installer for 10.6-10.7.

<h3>Linux</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div>
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>,
      but if your machine is set up differently
      you can run it by opening a terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.
      There is no need to install anything.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      If Git is not already available on your machine you can try
      to install it via your distro's package manager
      (e.g. <code>apt-get</code> or <code>yum</code>).
    </p>
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for Linux users.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
